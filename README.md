# VUMenu

VUMenu is a new text-based messaging app for providing students with the menus of various dining halls around campus. It works in a very simple way. A user will text the server the name of the campus dining option, and time of day (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and the server responds with all of the items on the menu for that meal period. Entrees, sides, and desserts will be broken down into subcategories and show them in an easy to read format for mobile phones.

From personal experience and the potential users I have interviewed, I believe there is a need for another method for obtaining the daily menus for campus dining halls. The current app often has unexpected crashes and can give incorrect information about what food is available. The full site is hard to use on a mobile phone so the next best option would be using texts. It doesn’t rely on having a data connection and many students are texting frequently anyway.  The excuse “I don’t have the app” is no longer a reason for someone to know what the menu options for the day are.

Some features that are going to be implemented are things such as being able to find vegetarian, gluten-free or vegan options, sending an automated text to users when large specials such as S.S. Rand and Commons Ball. Additionally, users will be able to register their favorite rotating dishes and be notified any time they are available on campus. This way, users will be informed about their favorite meals and be more inclined to stay on campus.

#Answers

##Question 1: 
  A1: I walk into wherever I wanna eat and see what they got. Or by word of mouth
  
  A2: I ask my friends or check the online portal
  
  A3: Although there is variety, I feel like the food options on campus are definitely lacking. Lunch provides a good assortment of options,      particularly at Rand. However for dinner there are hardly any options.
  
##Question 2: 
  A1: More or less. It's fine but could be improved to make menus more easily accessible.
  
  A2: No, the mobile app is terrible and it is not always up to date.
  
  A3: I am not too happy with the current method. I feel as though there are limited options and times for eating, which are tough to abide by with busy schedules.

##Question 3: 
  A1: Pretty familiar but don't know all of them off the top of my head. A quick Google search usually tells me
  
  A2: Not very familiar, there are different opening and closing time for various places on campus.
  
  A3: I know what all the hours are for dining halls on campus.
  
##Question 4: 
  A1: Almost never. I only depend on word of mouth.
  
  A2: I would say that my friends and I check about half the time.
  
  A3: Rarely check the menus.
  
##Question 5: 
  A1: Yes, if I hear there's a special that I like, I'll probably eat there since it can be hard to find variation in campus dining options.
  
  A2: I would say 6 out 10 times it plays a role.
  
  A3: Only for Kissam/EBI.
  
##Question 6: 
  A1: What's being served and when.
  
  A2: How close is it to where I am, type of food, and amount of food I will get.
  
  A3: What time it is and what day of the week.
  
##Question 7: 
  A1: An easier way to know the menu options would be nice. The campus dining app is pretty useless.
  
  A2: Tell me wait times.
  
  A3: Rand’s hours need to be improved, Rand during lunch needs to be faster, meal periods are highly restrictive, more all you can eat options (or at least for certain things i.e. Rand breakfast). Tower’s munchie mart should be 24 hrs on weekends, bring back Chick-Fil-A, better coffee on campus.
  
##Question 8: 
  A1: Rand
  
  A2: Rand
  
  A3: Rand
